# Guardian Save: Banking Transaction Prototype 🚀

## 📚 Project Overview  
**Guardian Save** is a web-based application designed for secure transaction requests between a guardian and a dependent. It demonstrates a simple yet effective account management system, making it a practical solution for educational and prototype use.

---

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Role-based Access**: Separate dashboards for guardians and dependents.
- **Transaction Validation**: Guardians approve or reject transaction requests.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Interacts with a MySQL database for user and transaction management.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites  

1. **Environment Setup**:  
   - Install a local server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/).  
   - Ensure **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **Apache** are properly configured.

2. **Database Configuration**:  
   - Import the provided SQL file (`guardian_safe.sql`) into MySQL.  
   - Ensure the database is named `test` and contains the following tables:  
     - **`parents`**: For guardian data (e.g., token ID, UPI PIN).  
     - **`children`**: For dependent data (e.g., username, parent token ID).

## 🚀 How to Run  

### **Step-by-Step Flow**

1. **Home Page**  
   - Open `index.html` in your browser.  
   - **New User?**  
     - Navigate to the **Registration Page** to create a username and role (Guardian or Dependent).

2. **Login**  
   - Use your credentials to log in.  
     - **Guardian**: Redirects to `dashboarda.php`.  
     - **Dependent**: Redirects to `dashboarda.php`.

3. **Dependent Actions**  
   - After logging in, the dependent can submit transaction requests via `dashboardb.php`.  
   - Fill in required details (e.g., amount, reason) and send for guardian approval.

4. **Guardian Actions**  
   - Log in to `dashboarda.php` to view pending requests.  
   - Click on a request to navigate to `approve.php`.  
   - In `approve.php`, approve or reject requests.  
   - **Approval Flow**: If approved, you must validate the action using your UPI PIN.

5. **Approval and Completion**  
   - Upon UPI PIN validation, the request status is updated in the database, and the dependent is notified.
